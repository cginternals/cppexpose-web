*cppexpose* allows for a C++ program to expose its interfaces into runtime, making it possible to, e.g., create automatic GUI representations for interfaces, or to expose them into a scripting environment. 
The implementation is based on standard C++ templates and does not use language extensions
or macros, making it typesafe and usable with any C++11 compliant toolchain. Also, no meta
compilation step is required.
